# Congressional Text Extraction, Classification, and Analysis using Python's NLTK Library and the Twitter API

# Abstract
This project aims to leverage natural language processing tools to perform a statistical analysis of congressional tweets. Through the combination of observations regarding reoccuring strings and recorded qualities, data can be processed via textual extraction, classification, and analysis mechanisms contained within the aforementioned NLTK library.
Sentiment analysis and topic analysis can be acheived through text classification, while text extraction can be utilized in the form of named entity recognition, which provides potential for the acknowledgement of frequential correlations between congress members and their Twitter account content. This data can be stored in a relational database such as MSSQL or MySQL. 

# Relevance
The following components are both a topic of this course and modular aspects of the proposed project:
Object-oriented design - A UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram has been created to delineate the relationships between various entities of our object-oriented program (See Abstract).
Test-driven development - The proposed project supports test-driven development as a means of ensuring code maintainability. It is suggested to utilize this learned approach, as it will effectually increase the efficiency of collaboration.
Unified Modeling Language - See first component listed.
Design patterns - To enlist the robustness of "coding to an interface", the Strategy design pattern is depicted as an integral part of the UML design.
Graphical user interface - With a project of this nature, effective data visualization is a substantial portion of its feasibility. Python has numerous libraries that can be leveraged to present a thorough statistical analysis. Additionally, graph theory concepts can be implemented manually to show relational frequencies (e.g., weighted edges connecting nodes representing congress members - each edge depicting the rate of mention between one congress member and another).
Access to database - Accessing a database is paramount in allowing for effective and persistent data storage, particularly when concerned with derived attributes or data. To this effect, the source code, written in Python, will make use of a MSSQL or MySQL database.
